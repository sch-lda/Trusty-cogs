# [How to use ReTrigger](https://github.com/TrustyJAID/Trusty-cogs/blob/master/retrigger/README.md)

ReTrigger is a highly versatile cog that allows server moderators and administrators to automatically perform many tasks based on regular expressions (regex) in chat. https://regex101.com/ Is suggested to test out any regular expression patterns you want before adding to the bot. Some commonly used tools include:

 - `\b` meaning word boundaries usually used at the beginning and end of the word or sentence to avoid triggering on `testing` when you only want `test`. (e.g. regex of `\bhello, world\b` will __only__ trigger if someone says exactly `hello, world` and not `hello, worlds`.)

 - `(?i)` at the beginning of the regex will ignore cases in the search so `test`, `Test`, and `TEST` are treated the same.

 - **Groups** can be utilized to pick specific parts of the pattern to be used later. Groups look like `(^I wanna be )(.+)` where everything inside the `()` brackets are a group. Groups are numbered 0 and up where 0 is the full pattern, 1 would be `I wanna be ` and 2 would be `.+`. In this example anything after the words `I wanna be ` is captured and can then be used in the response of the trigger by using `{2}` to signify group 2.
    - Named regex groups can be utilized as well for example: `(^I wanna be )(?P<tracer>.+)` then `{tracer}` can be used in the response instead of a numbered group.

 - More useful special characters:
    - `^` signifies the start of a string.
  - `$` signifies the end of a string.
  - `?` 0 or 1 of the previous character or group.
  - `+` 1 or more of the previous character or group.
  - `*` 0 or more of the previous character or group.
  - `.` any character other than newline.
  - `|` **or** statement meaning this **or** that.
- **If your regex has spaces make sure to enclose the regex in "double quotes"**


## [replacements](https://github.com/TrustyJAID/Trusty-cogs/blob/master/retrigger/README.md#replacements)
You can replace part of most strings with the context the command was run in. The following are discord objects that you can use to replace some data in your string with:
- `{author}` The author of the message that triggered. See https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#member for available attributes.
- `{guild}` or `{server}` The server the message was triggered in. See https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#guild for available attributes.
- `{channel}` The channel the message was triggered in. See https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#textchannel for available attributes.
- `{message}` The message that triggered. See https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#message for available attributes.

For most of these you will want to use `.` to get the attribute. For example `{author.display_name}` will be replaced with the message authors current display name as you see it in the server at the time the message triggered.

Special replacement parameters are as follows:
- `{p}` can be used to replace the bots default prefix in the message.
- `{pp}` can be used to list all the bots prefixes available on the server.
- `{count}` can be used to show the number of times a trigger has been triggered.
- `{nummatch}` can be used to replace the number of matches the pattern found.
- `{lenmessage}` can be used to replace the length of the message.
- `{lenmatch}` can be used to replace the length of the largest match found.

## [Utility Commands](https://github.com/TrustyJAID/Trusty-cogs/blob/master/retrigger/README.md#utility-commands)
### **list**
__Usage:__ `[p]retrigger list [trigger]`
Lists all triggers in the server as an interactable menu.

- `[trigger]` is the optional name of a specific trigger to start the menu at.
- ▶ will display the next trigger in the list.
- ◀ will display the previous trigger in the list.
- ⏭ will jump to the last trigger in the list.
- ⏮ will jump to the first trigger in the list.
- ⏯ will toggle the displayed triggers active setting.
- ❎ will toggle the displayed trigger to be not active.
- ✅ will toggle the displayed trigger to be active.
- 🚮 will delete the displayed trigger.


### **remove**
__Usage:__ `[p]retrigger remove <trigger>`
- `<trigger>` is the name of the trigger you want to delete.
This will delete a trigger.

### **blocklist**
Set blocklist options for specified triggers.
Blacklist will ensure **everyone except** the objects added to the trigger blocklist will trigger. For example if you blocklist a role for the trigger anyone with that role will **not** trigger it. This can be useful for removing select bad actors from spamming specific triggers over and over. **Note:** If a allowlist is present on the trigger anything in the blocklist is ignored.
 - **add** Add a channel, user, or role to a triggers blocklist.
  __Usage:__ `[p]retrigger blocklist add <trigger> [channel_user_role...]`
 	multiple channels, users, or roles can be added at the same time.
 - **remove** Remove a channel, user, or role from a triggers blocklist.
  __Usage:__ `[p]retrigger blocklist remove <trigger> [channel_user_role...]`
 	multiple channels, users, or roles can be added at the same time.

### **allowlist**
Set allowlist options for specified triggers.
Whitelist will ensure **only** the objects added to the trigger allowlist will actually trigger. For example if you allowlist a role for the trigger only users with that role can actually trigger it. This can be useful for setting specific triggers to only occur in a specified channel and help with automatic moderation of specific channels/users/roles.
 - **add** Add a channel, user, or role to a triggers allowlist.
 __Usage:__ `[p]retrigger allowlist add <trigger> [channel_user_role...]`
 	multiple channels, users, or roles can be added at the same time.
 - **remove** Remove a channel, user, or role from a triggers allowlist.
 __Usage:__ `[p]retrigger allowlist remove <trigger> [channel_user_role...]`
 	multiple channels, users, or roles can be added at the same time.

## **modlog**
Set which events to record in the modlog. ReTrigger has a built in modlog setup which can be used to track when and how ReTrigger is performing automated moderation actions.

 - **addroles** Toggle custom add role messages in the modlog.
 - **bans** Toggle custom ban messages in the modlog.
 - **channel** Set the modlog channel for filtered words.
 - **filter** Toggle custom filter messages in the modlog.
 - **kicks** Toggle custom kick messages in the modlog.
 - **removeroles** Toggle custom add role messages in the modlog.
 - **settings** Show the current modlog settings for this server.

Edit various settings in a set trigger. under `[p]retrigger edit`
### regex
 - Edit the regex of a saved trigger.
 - Note: **This command does not require double quotes for spaces in the regex**
### edited
 - Toggle whether the bot will listen to edited messages as well as `on_message` for the specified trigger.
 ### ignorecommands
 - Toggle the regex matching inside normally ignored command messages.
 ### ocr
 - Toggle whether to use Optical Character Recognition to search for text within images. **Requires `pytesseract-ocr` and [google tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) be installed on the host machine.**
### react
 - Edit the emoji reactions of a saved trigger. **Note:** This cannot be used on *multi* triggers.
### command
 - Edit the text of a saved trigger. **Note:** This cannot be used on *multi* triggers.
### role
 - Edit the added or removed roles of a saved trigger. **Note:** This cannot be used on *multi* triggers.
### text
 - Edit the response text of a saved trigger. **Note:** This cannot be used on *multi* triggers.
### readfilenames
 - Edit whether or not a trigger will append filenames of attachments to the search.
### deleteafter
 - Text triggers can have an optional delete_after time set, this can be used to edit it.
### chance
 - Triggers can be setup with a chance to occur in form of `1 in chance`.
### readembeds
 - Toggle whether the bot will search the contents of embeds. **Requires `edited` also be enabled.**

### cooldown
 - Edit cooldown options for specified triggers. This can be used to ensure a trigger is not constantly spammed by giving some time until it is allowed to be triggered again. Time must be in seconds.
### chance
 - Edit the chance a trigger has to trigger. This is a random number between 0 and the number you choose. When the trigger regex matches this number is rolled and if it is 0 the trigger will execute otherwise it will be ignored.
### readthreads
 - Toggle whether a filter trigger will check thread titles.
   - This only works in conjunction with delete triggers. If a thread is created with a title that would match the delete triggers pattern the thread will be deleted. This also requires the bot to have manage_threads permission in the channel the threads are created in.
### nsfw
 - Toggle whether a trigger is considered NSFW preventing it from activating in non Age Restricted channels.
### reply
 - Set whether or not to reply to the triggered message.
   - This only works in conjunction with text response and image response triggers. Setting to `True` will ping the user, setting to `False` will not ping the user, and leaving blank will not reply to the message at all but will still trigger.
### thread
- Set whether or not the Trigger will attempt to create a thread on the message.
  - You can set it to be either a public or private thread.
  - A thread name is required and utilizes object conversion to automatically make a thread with the users name. See the replacements section for more info on what can be replaced.
### mention
 - Settings to control a trigger responses [AllowedMentions](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#allowedmentions) to allow the trigger to mention everyone/roles/users overriding the bots default settings.



## [F.A.Q.](https://github.com/TrustyJAID/Trusty-cogs/blob/master/retrigger/README.md#faq)
__Can ReTrigger perform different actions if a user triggers it enough times?__
 - No. This is better suited for an entirely separate cog. This one is highly complex as it is and meant more as a versatile trigger system not automatic moderation although it can still be used as an automatic moderation tool.

__Can ReTrigger warn a user automatically?__
 - Yes! Although there is a risk involved in allowing this, as such it's hidden by normal usage. What you want to do is `[p] retrigger mock` which will then perform the same function as the `command` trigger but rather than run the command as the user who sent the message it runs the command as the user who *created* the trigger. Meaning that it's possible to supply someone full bot access if you're not careful with how you handle this and one could even force shutoff the bot. So be careful but the utility is there.

 __Can ReTrigger read the headers of files uploaded to see if they're malicious?__
  - No. This is something discord already handles for the most part and if it's an issue you have on a regular basis ensure you're reporting to discord. If you were looking instead to read the text inside an image for bad words that *is* do-able now through Optical Character Recognition support requiring that `pytesseract-ocr` and [google tesseract]([https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)) are installed on the host machine. Then your trigger needs to have OCR toggled on.

__ReTrigger seems to be taking up a lot of ram, is this normal?__
 - Unfortunately yes it is. In order to allow *safe* regular expression searches with full features and not let bad users input a regex pattern that will take minutes-hours to fully search due to regression the cog utilizes multiprocessing which increases the memory usage. I would recommend adding more SWAP memory to alleviate some of these issues if you're tight on ram.

 __ReTrigger filter isn't working for me!__
  - Most likely the people you have testing it have Manage Messages permission. This was done because people with that permission are more than likely trusted not to post things they shouldn't be and they have the power to remove those messages from other people. No there's no way to bypass this, they're immune as an extra layer of protection alongside people with ban members permission so that people can't ban themselves or supply themselves roles they're not supposed to. Last thing you want is to accidentally ban someone for something silly like a bot function.

__ReTrigger stopped responding to one of my triggers, HALP!__
 - That's not a question? Anyways please share full details and tracebacks in my channel in the cog server. I suspect the issue might be that you ran out of memory and the trigger took too long to respond which will automatically kick out the trigger assuming it was poorly structured regex. Reloading the cog should fix this but if you're still having issues and increasing your SWAP space did not help you might look at `[p]retrigger bypass` which will allow you to disable the safe regex searching in servers you fully trust the mod team to not try and crash your bot.

 __Regex is hard, couldn't you just do a normal trigger option?__
  - I fully understand the learning curve of regex. When I started this cog I had no idea how to use regular expressions. That said I knew of its power and I hope by puting this cog out there more people can learn of its versatility. The tools are there and likely a lot easier than you might think. Play around with it and have fun!
